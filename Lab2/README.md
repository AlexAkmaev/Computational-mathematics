The linear equation system given in the problem is solved by Gauss and Seidel methods,  
the minimum and maximum eigenvalues are found,  
and the condition number of the matrix Î¼ is determined.  
Method residuals are printed.  
The criterion for stopping iterations of the Seidel method is specified.
