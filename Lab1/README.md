For different methods of calculating the derivative at the point x = 5, plot the absolute error value depending on the step of numerical differentiation for n = 1,..., 21 for the following functions:  
'''
sin(x^2), cos(sin(x)), exp(sin(cos(x)), In(x+3), sqrt(x+3)
'''  
The logarithmic scale on both axes is used. Error graphs for each function are plotted in a separate window.
